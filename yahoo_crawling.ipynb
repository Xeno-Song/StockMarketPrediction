The deal is part of AMC’s long-term effort to secure the capital needed to execute its turnaround, even if that means diluting investors seeking to cash in on short-term rallies.', '“You’d be crazy not to sell shares into this ridiculousness if you’re running the company,” said Tuttle Capital Management CEO Matthew Tuttle.', 'As of May 8, the company could raise roughly $125 million in additional cash through the program, meaning it could sell some 24 million shares based on Monday’s $5.19 close.', 'The financing deal has already generated $124 million, before commissions and fees, through the sale of 38.5 million common shares after being unveiled in March. That would indicate an average price of $3.22, a more than 90% plunge from where the stock was trading just a year ago.', 'While the dilution would hit the very investors that have powered the shares higher, it’s nothing new for AMC or the meme-stock crowd. Over the past four years, the company has announced at least five equity offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show, selling millions of shares in the process.', 'Navigating a massive debt load of $4.5 billion has been top of mind for AMC management, something the share sales are meant to address. The company had $624 million in cash and equivalents at the end of March, after losing nearly $165 million in the quarter, according to a filing last week.', 'The gains “may do little to soothe concerns surrounding structural issues for the movie-theater chain,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Geetha Ranganathan and Kevin Near wrote Monday.', 'Even after the stock’s Monday surge, it remains down 99% from its June 2021 closing high.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits', 'Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges', '‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA', 'How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags', 'Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

Meme-stock traders again piled into GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., after the shares of both firms soared during the previous session in a revival of the retail frenzy.', 'A Bloomberg dollar index was flat and 10-year Treasury yields little changed ahead of US producer prices released Tuesday, a key inflation gauge indicator. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak, while consumer price index due Wednesday is projected to show moderation while still remaining too high to advance the pace of rate cuts.', '“Markets this morning are in extremely quiet mood ahead of tomorrow’s US consumer price index data that’s going to come out and shake things up or not,” said Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at Societe Generale SA. “Sentiment about what the Fed’s going to do, sentiment about a lot of markets, will be determined by core CPI.”', 'Wagers on interest rate cuts later this year have sent investor optimism to a two-and-a-half-year high, but stocks will suffer if evidence of stagflation materializes, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett.', 'Despite the lift in sentiment, BofA’s global poll also shows that expectations for global growth have fallen for the first time since November, with a net 9% of participants now anticipating a weaker economy over the next 12 months. Still, about 78% said a recession was unlikely over the time.', 'Elsewhere, President Joe Biden hiked tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports in his most comprehensive update to tariffs first imposed by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.', 'In Europe, the benchmark stock gauge was little changed, hovering near a record high. Shares in Anglo American Plc fell after the London-based miner outlined a major shake-up to fend of a takeover approach from BHP Group, with analysts citing execution risks. Delivery Hero SE soared as much as 24% after selling its Taiwan business. A revenue beat by Tencent Holdings Ltd. pushed the stock of its largest shareholder, Prosus NV, higher.']\n"

      "['(Bloomberg) — GameStop Corp. shares more than doubling on no fundamental news. Short sellers getting squeezed and retail traders using same-day options to amplify gains in otherwise beaten-down stocks. Nonsense crypto coins adding more than 1,000%.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Trump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind', 'GameStop Shares Soar as ‘Roaring Kitty’ Revitalizes Meme Mania', 'China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy', 'Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk’s Cuts', 'That was Monday. But it could just as easily describe early 2021, when the meme-stock frenzy captured the popular imagination and day traders sent stocks on inexplicable wild rides. However a closer look at the magnitude and zaniness back then shows how much further this latest meme mania needs to go to match the original.', 'In the first go-round three years ago, GameStop soared more than 1,000% in a few days, as retail traders took to Reddit Inc.’s Wall Street Bets forum to rally against Wall Street bigwigs who were short the stock. Today, those “Reddit Raiders,” once flush with time and cash from pandemic-era stimulus and work policies, are largely back to work and bearing the burden of higher interest rates. Some got in late, and even with the latest surge are sitting on losses.', 'In addition, traders with an itch to gamble now have a bevy of choices for wagering. Casinos and racetracks were closed back then due to Covid, leaving stocks as the main game in town. Since then gambling has gone mainstream, and anyone who wants to place a bet can basically get action on any game they want from a few clicks on their phone.', 'Professional short sellers have also have largely given up on taking aim at companies with relatively small share floats, worried that the power of social media could foment a squeeze. And volumes in short-dated options, while still elevated, are nowhere near the levels seen in 2021.', '“These are always blips, they’re like solar eclipses — they happen and then they go away for a long time and then they happen again,” said Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary. “But if you look at them they always appear at extremes in sentiment.”', 'Monday’s buying was triggered by a single post on X Sunday night from Keith Gill, the retail-trading icon who goes by the moniker “Roaring Kitty” and drove the original mania before disappearing from social media in June 2021. In less than an hour, GameStop added some $6 billion in market value as traders pumped Gill’s return to tweeting as a sign that the boom was back. Former meme darling AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rallied more than 80%. And newly listed Reddit powered higher by as much as 14%. In cryptocurrencies, the Roaring Kitty token is up more than 4,000%.']\n"

The index had slumped in March to the lowest level since December 2012. Despite the rebound it was the 28th straight month the index was below the 50-year average of 98.', 'Twenty-two percent of owners reported that inflation was their single most important problem in operating their business, down 3 points from March. The share of businesses planning price hikes dropped 7 points to 26%, the smallest since April 2023.', 'The proportion raising average selling prices fell three points to 25%. But the optimism over slower price increases was tempered somewhat by an elevated share of owners raising compensation. A 38% share of owners reported increasing compensation, unchanged from March.', \"Twenty-one percent planned to boost compensation over the next three months, also unchanged from March. The NFIB reported last week that 40% of owners reported job openings they could not fill in April, rebounding 3 points from March's lowest reading since January 2021.\", '\"Cost pressures remain the top issue for small business owners, including historically high levels of owners raising compensation to keep and attract employees,\" said Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB chief economist.', 'Inflation surged in the first quarter after slowing for much of last year amid strong domestic demand. Economists are hopeful that prices will resume their downward trend this quarter amid signs that the labor market is cooling.', 'Financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to start its easing cycle in September, though some economists believe the first interest rate cut could come in July.', 'The U.S. central bank early this month left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since July. The Fed has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points since March 2022.', '(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)']\n"

      "[\"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\", 'The chart of the day', \"What we're watching\", \"What we're reading\", 'Economic data releases and earnings', 'Bob Iger is just like you and me — he watches a lot of Netflix (NFLX). But now, the Disney CEO is talking about it.', '\"Netflix is, in many respects, the gold standard when it comes to streaming,\" Iger said during the company\\'s quarterly earnings call on May 7.', \"And he's not the only big-shot media exec praising rival platforms either.\", '\"Disney itself is a fabulous company,\" Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav piped in on Thursday.', 'Amazon received compliments too, as WBD streaming chief JB Perrette said: \"Obviously, Amazon and Netflix are both incredibly compelling.\"', 'Those quotes, ripped from the call transcripts of competing media companies this earnings season, make one thing abundantly clear: The streaming giants have called a truce.', 'It\\'s no accident that this \"kumbaya\" moment is arriving now. The rules of the game had already been changing. Once upon a time, all Wall Street rewarded was subscriber growth as numerous platforms flooded the market. Profitability? Who cared. Free cash flow? Never heard of her.', 'The goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.', 'At the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.', 'Others soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast\\'s NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.', \"Then Wall Street started to change its tune. Could streaming — an incredibly cheap way for consumers to access their favorite content at the touch of a button — become an actual business? Investors weren't so sure. The industry scrambled to prove them wrong.\", \"There were price hikes and password-sharing crackdowns. Ad-supported tiers and mass layoffs. That helped with streaming profitability across the board, although the majority of companies (minus Netflix and WBD) still don't make money in those divisions.\"]\n"

Over the past months, leading Lebanese political parties have become increasingly vocal, demanding the Syrian refugees go back.', 'A tiny Mediterranean country of about 6 million people, Lebanon hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita.', 'In the northeastern town of Arsal, Syrian refugees piled their belongings onto the back of trucks and cars on Tuesday as Lebanese security officers collected their U.N. refugee agency cards and other paperwork before clearing them to leave.', 'As the trucks pulled away, the refugees waved to friends and relatives staying behind, heading to an uncertain future in Syria.', 'Ahmad al-Rifai, on his way to the Qalamoun Mountains after over a decade in Lebanon, said that whatever the situation was is in Syria, “it’s better to live in a house than in a tent.”', 'Lebanese security forces this year stepped up deportations of Syrians, although nowhere near the level threatened two years ago when the Lebanese government announced a plan to deport some 15,000 Syrians every month, to what they dubbed “ safe areas,” in cooperation with the government in Damascus.', \"Tuesday's convoy from the mountainous towns of Arsal and Qaa consisted of only 330 refugees who had signed up for repatriation, the first such “voluntary return” return organized by Lebanese security forces since late 2022.\", '“Nobody can not be happy to return to their home,” Ahmad Durro told The Associated Press while waiting in his truck. “I signed up a year ago to be in the convoy.”', \"But many other Syrians — especially young men facing compulsory military service or political opponents of the government of President Bashar Assad — say it's unsafe to return.\", 'Others see no future in Syria, where in many parts the fighting may have died down but an economic crisis has pulled millions into poverty.', 'An increasing number of refugees in Lebanon have taken to the sea in an attempt to reach Europe.', 'The UNHCR has said it only supports voluntary returns of Syrians based on informed consent, while human rights organizations remain skeptical of the voluntary nature of these returns amid anti-refugee hostility in Lebanon.']\n"

While that’s a 21% decline from a year earlier, it topped the $222 million analysts expected on average. Sales also beat estimates, and the net loss of $23.7 million was narrower than analysts predicted.', 'Sea is fighting to maintain its dominance in Southeast Asia’s e-commerce arena as competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as TikTok and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Lazada heats up. Newer entrants like Shein and PDD Holdings Inc.’s Temu are also gaining users in the region of about 675 million people, where more shoppers are moving online.', 'The results are set to give confidence to investors focused on assessing if Sea can sustain double-digit growth rates while improving its bottom line. Its shares have advanced more than 80% from a mid-January low and are hovering close to their highest in 12 months. Yet they remain far below historic highs.', 'Read more: Sea’s 90% Stock Rally Sets Bar High for Earnings to Impress', 'The earnings beat comes even as Sea spends on marketing to ward off rivals, and on research and development to add live-streaming and artificial intelligence features. E-commerce gross merchandise volume, or the value of goods sold, rose 36% to $23.6 billion, topping estimates. Revenue for the group climbed 23% to $3.7 billion.', 'The company’s gaming arm, known for its hit Free Fire, is struggling to come up with new titles to boost sales. Revenue at the unit, called Garena, declined about 15% to $458 million.', 'What Bloomberg Intelligence Says', 'Marketing costs will likely stay elevated, but adjusted Ebitda should still grow as Shopee’s dominance in Southeast Asian e-commerce and a dense user ecosystem lure more merchants into high-margin services such as advertising. This scale advantage might be its strongest defense against the encroachment of TikTok, IPO-bound Shein and PDD Holdings’ Temu in e-commerce in the region.', '— Nathan Naidu, analyst']\n"

The inflation rate is set to edge back under single digits in April for the first time in six months.', '\"No matter how much the inflation rate goes down, which is what everyone says, it is not reflected here because look, there are items that should have gone down but haven\\'t,\" said Sandra Boluch, 50, a fruit and vegetable seller in Buenos Aires.', \"She said her store had been forced to raise workers' salaries because their rents had increased, while input costs of things like plastic bags had gone up, all feeding back into the sticker price for carrots and apples.\", '\"These (prices) increase a lot and then that\\'s reflected elsewhere. Where? In the merchandise,\" she said. \"Transportation is more expensive, diesel prices go up, everything goes up. So no matter how much we try to reduce prices, we can\\'t.\"', 'The government of libertarian President Javier Milei, which inherited a major economic crisis, has touted its success in lowering monthly inflation, which has declined this year since Milei took office on Dec. 10 and sharply devalued the local peso currency, unleashing an initial inflation surge.', \"Milei has pushed a tough austerity campaign with cost-cutting and looked to soak up liquidity in the market, which has gone down well with investors, and has helped boost the government's fiscal position and propelled a rally of equities and bonds.\", '\"He generated a monetary austerity shock, stopped injecting pesos into the economy, and gave a strong signal of fiscal austerity,\" said Eugenio Mari, chief economist at consultancy Libertad and Progreso Foundation.', 'That economic medicine has also hit salaries and economic activity hard, though Mari said things should get better.', '\"A sharp drop in real wages implies a drop in aggregate demand, a drop in consumption and, obviously, a drop in economic activity. But the interesting thing is that now, with the drop in inflation, the door is open for real wages to recover.\"', \"Ofelia D'Aquino, 65, a retiree in Buenos Aires leaving a supermarket, said he didn't yet feel the inflation slowdown. Retirees, along with public sector workers, have taken the biggest hit from Milei's austerity.\"]\n"

She advised against the intuitive choice of withdrawing from regular savings or Roth IRA accounts first.', 'Instead, she suggested prioritizing withdrawals from accounts that impose tax implications, like traditional or rollover IRAs. \"You are not making that much money,\" Orman explained, pointing out that Ellen’s primary income comes from her Social Security, which is tax-free under her current financial conditions.', 'Ellen’s situation, Orman noted, positions her advantageously for tapping into her traditional or rollover IRA accounts. By doing so, Ellen could potentially withdraw up to $15,000 a year without owing taxes, thanks to the standard deduction. This method maximizes the tax-free growth benefits of her Roth IRA, allowing those funds to accumulate interest longer, potentially increasing her financial stability in later years.', 'Trending: If the United States had access to today’s high-yield savings accounts rates in 2015, it wouldn’t need to save another penny.', 'KT, Orman’s co-host, admitted to leaning toward simpler withdrawal strategies, underscoring the complexity and importance of informed financial planning in retirement. Orman’s expert advice not only addressed Ellen’s query but also educated listeners on the nuanced decisions retirees must navigate to optimize their financial resources.', 'Traditional financial experts often recommend several strategies for withdrawing retirement funds, which can contrast with the specific advice given by Suze Orman. The most commonly cited strategy is the 4% rule, suggesting that retirees withdraw 4% of their retirement portfolio in the first year, adjusting annually for inflation to ensure the fund lasts at least 30 years. However, Suze has called this move \"very dangerous\" in today\\'s economic climate.', 'By understanding the tax implications and growth potential of different retirement accounts, retirees like Ellen can make informed decisions that enhance their financial longevity and stability.']\n"

      "['Imagine that you’re 65 years old and just completed a Roth conversion during a low-tax year early in retirement to avoid future required minimum distributions (RMDs). However, not long after the conversion, you want to withdraw the money you just paid taxes on. But pursuing the withdrawal without first understanding the five-year rule for Roth IRAs could leave you paying income taxes and penalties on the money.', 'Need help planning your Roth conversion or navigating the five-year rule? Connect with a financial advisor today.', 'Would the rule apply to you in this situation? Unfortunately, the answer is the ever unsatisfying \"it depends.\" In fact, there are actually several five-year rules to be aware of with Roth IRAs. We\\'ll review two that would likely come into play and explore how they would impact your withdrawal strategy.', 'The first five-year rule, which applies to Roth IRA contributions, centers around whether withdrawals of any accumulated earnings will be taxed. This rule requires the account owners to wait at least five tax years from the time of their first contribution – whether it was made directly or via conversion – to withdraw earnings, provided they have reached age 59 ½. If you make subsequent contributions or open new Roth accounts, the clock does not restart.', 'For distributions of earnings to be qualified – that is, tax-free – you must satisfy the age requirement and this five-year rule. Exceptions to the age requirement exist for the death of the account owner, disabilities and first-time homebuyers. But even in the case of these exceptions, the five-year rule must be met or any earnings taken from the account will be taxable.', 'If you are at least 59 ½ years old but have not met the five-year rule requirement, then you will pay income taxes on any earnings that are withdrawn. Since contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, you can always withdraw the value of your contributions free of taxes and penalties, but any gains generated and distributed before the five-year period ends will be taxed. The distribution would also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are not 59 ½ years old. (Speak with a financial advisor if you need help navigating the five-year rule for your Roth IRA.)', 'The second five-year rule relates specifically to Roth conversions and whether an early withdrawal of converted principal will be taxed. In effect, the rule only applies if you take a distribution before you turn 59 ½.']\n"

While most strategists were expecting a recession last year or eagerly attempting to call the start of one in the next year, we have been of the view that the ~5 quarters 1Q22 to 2Q23 were a \\'pseudo-recession\\' and the Fed has already harvested all the normal post-recession disinflation we would expect,\" the firm wrote.', \"Inflation still remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew 3.5% year-per-year in March, the third straight month of hotter-than-expected inflation.\", 'Elevated prices could be attributed to a still-hot economy, which is stoking price growth, strategists said. Hiring activity, for instance, remains robust, which can stoke wage growth and therefore raise inflation.', '\"As a result, the sustained 2% Core PCE inflation the Feed seeks is a pipe dream. With rates normalized and the mid-2024 pop in Core PCE to just over 3% that our models indicate we expect Fed rate cuts to be pushed back further, causing a middle quarters correction for equities,\" strategists added.', \"Markets have already dialed back their outlook for Fed rate cuts this year, which drove a sell-of in stocks in April. Fed officials have said they're looking for more evidence that inflation is falling back to its 2% price target, and investors are now just expecting one or two rate cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool, compared to six at the start of 2024.\", \"Traders are waiting for April inflation data to roll out this week, but central bankers are largely expected to keep interest rates at their current levels. Markets have priced in a 96% chance rates will be kept level at the Fed's next policy meeting, and a 75% chance rates will stay the same all summer.\", 'Read the original article on Business Insider']\n"

      "['In the realm of retirement savings, only a select few in the United States achieve the milestone of a $5 million nest egg.', 'Data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, based on the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, reveals that a mere 0.1% of retirees manage to accumulate over $5 million in their retirement accounts, whereas only 3.2% amass over $1 million.', \"Don't Miss:\", '82% of Americans aren’t using this government secured 5% passive income stream, are you one of them?', 'Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.', 'A look at those with around $5 million in savings, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, shows that such retirees often did not anticipate reaching such financial heights. They were consistent in their savings efforts from early in their careers, yet their lifestyles remained modest. Many continue to work part-time, forego frequent new clothing purchases, and, while they do splurge on global travel, they share the same concerns about health and family as other older Americans.', \"Meanwhile, Northwestern Mutual’s research indicates that Americans believe they need around $1.46 million to retire comfortably. Yet, the median retirement savings account balance paints a grimmer picture, standing at only $87,000, according to the latest figures from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. Here’s how these figures breakdown by age group:\", '—Under 35: $18,880', '—35-44: $45,000', '—45-54: $115,000', '—55-64: $185,000', '—65-74: $200,000', '—75 or older: $130,000', 'While the average balance across all families is higher at $333,940, this number is skewed upward by the wealthiest households. Besides retirement accounts, many retirees also have substantial amounts held in regular savings, brokerage accounts, and investment properties.', 'The equity in a retiree’s home also significantly contributes to their financial security. In 2021, home equity accounted for a median of 45% of the total net worth of U.S. homeowners, indicating a significant portion of an average person’s wealth comes from their primary residence.', 'The picture of American retirees’ financial health is thus more nuanced than it appears. Financial planners advise considering all assets and net worth to fully assess retirement readiness, rather than focusing solely on retirement account balances.', 'Although a $5 million nest egg is rare, achieving a comfortable retirement is still within reach. By consulting with a financial advisor, you can develop a tailored plan to meet your retirement goals based on your financial situation and lifestyle aspirations. A financial advisor can provide valuable insights and strategies to help you maximize your savings and ensure financial security for your retirement years.']\n"

      "['Considering taking a defensive driving course to lower your insurance premiums?', 'This is one auto insurance discount that’s not available to all drivers, but there are other reasons why brushing up on safe driving techniques is valuable, even if it won’t save you money.', 'Let’s take a deeper dive into what driving skills these courses typically teach, whether a defensive driving course can save you money, and how to determine if you’re eligible for this popular car insurance discount.', 'Defensive driving courses are public safety classes offered both in person and online. Typically, they combine text, audio, and video instruction and require passing a test to earn a certificate of completion.', 'The driving skills commonly covered in a defensive driver course include:', 'Basic road safety and crash statistics', 'Collision avoidance techniques', 'Your state and nationwide traffic laws', 'Road awareness, environmental hazards, and scanning techniques', 'How to maintain safe following and passing distance', 'Safety equipment', 'Vehicle emergencies', 'Drug and alcohol education', 'Requirements vary by state, but defensive driver training usually lasts anywhere from four to 12 hours. Although most defensive driving courses aren’t free, you can expect to pay a relatively affordable fee somewhere in the range of $25-$55 for an online class. In-person defensive driving courses may be more expensive, depending on your location.', 'In a majority of states, car insurance companies are required by state law to offer a discount to motorists over a certain age who complete an approved defensive driving course.', 'The following states do not have laws mandating defensive driving discounts. If you live in one of these states, you should still contact your insurance company for more information about potential discounts.', 'Arizona', 'Hawaii', 'Indiana', 'Iowa', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Michigan', 'Missouri', 'Nebraska', 'New Hampshire', 'North Carolina', 'Ohio', 'South Dakota', 'Texas', 'Vermont', 'Wisconsin', 'Some insurance companies offer defensive driving discounts to all drivers who meet the age criteria and take a defensive driving course regardless of state laws. The discount varies but usually falls in the range of 5% to 20% off your auto insurance premiums for three to five years.', 'It’s also worth noting that defensive driving discounts aren’t just for drivers over 50. Several insurers like State Farm and MetLife provide savings to teen drivers or young drivers under 25 who complete defensive driving courses. In fact, New York drivers of all ages are usually eligible for a defensive driving discount once they’ve completed the state’s Point and Insurance Reduction Program (PIRP).', 'Since defensive driving is all about avoiding an at-fault accident, most insurance companies reward drivers with a discount for taking and completing an approved course. Here’s how to determine if you’re eligible for a defensive driving discount and how to get it applied to your insurance premiums.', 'Two groups of drivers are usually eligible for defensive driving discounts: drivers under 25 or drivers over 50. These age groups are statistically more likely to be involved in an at-fault accident. Many states mandate discounts for certain drivers who take safe driving courses.', 'Defensive driver discounts may have other eligibility criteria such as not having an at-fault accident for the past several years or the absence of any serious traffic violations on your driving record. You can access the GEICO database of defensive driving discounts and courses to learn more about your state’s criteria.', 'Many vendors offer in-person classroom courses at traffic schools or other educational settings, or online courses, which can sometimes be done at your own pace. While online courses have the advantage of being cheaper and more convenient, you should check with your insurer (and state) to verify an online class qualifies for the insurance discount before you log on.', 'A few popular options for online safe driving courses are offered by AAA, AARP, American Safety Council, and the National Safety Council.', 'In some states, traffic school is optional to remove points from your license or may be part of a mandatory sentence for traffic tickets and other violations. These classes are typically different from the approved courses you’d take to earn an insurance discount.', 'To ensure the driver education course you’ve selected is eligible for an insurance discount, check your state laws and then contact your insurance agent to confirm the course qualifies.', 'Once you sign up for a driver safety class, the key is to show up and do the work. You may be required to answer questions or take a test to confirm your successful completion of the course.', 'Once you’ve passed, request proof of completion so that you can submit documentation to your insurer. This may be an electronic certificate or a form that gets sent directly to your auto insurance company.', 'You may need to follow up with your insurance company or agent directly to get the discount applied to your insurance policy. Once it’s been verified, that discount should be good for anywhere from three to five years.', 'When the discount expires, you may be eligible to take a defensive driving class again and get the discount reapplied depending on your age, state of residence, and other eligibility criteria.', 'Auto insurance discounts aren’t the only reason to take an accident prevention course or brush up on your driving skills. Getting a refresher on avoiding accidents and becoming a safer driver offers a kind of security behind the wheel that’s hard to put a price on.', 'Even if your safety course doesn’t qualify for an insurance discount, you could ultimately save money on your car insurance rates by avoiding expensive collisions, keeping your driver’s license from being suspended, and learning safe driving techniques that allow you to leverage telematics or usage-based insurance at some point down the road.', 'To find courses offered in your state that might qualify for a good driver discount, swing by your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles website.', 'For a state-by-state look at online defensive driving classes, start with the American Safety Council and the National Safety Council for more information.', 'Once you’ve completed a safe driving skills class, the insurance discount should last anywhere from three to five years.', 'This can vary according to state laws and each insurer’s rules, so continue to check your premiums and contact your insurance company with questions.', 'The cost can vary, but online defensive driving courses are typically $50 or less. Online classes tend to cost less, while in-person, full-day courses taught by an instructor usually cost more.', 'For instance, the online defensive driving course from the New York Safety Council, referred to as NY Online Defensive Driving (IPIRP), provides a 10% discount on insurance premiums for three years, can be taken every 18 months, and rings in at a bargain price of $24.95.']\n"

      "['When homeowners think about refinancing a mortgage, they don’t always distinguish between various refinance options. A traditional refinance, known as a “rate-and-term refinance” or “non-cash-out refinance,” refers to refinancing a mortgage into a new loan with a new interest rate. You’ll also have different loan terms, such as the length of the loan and whether the rate is fixed or adjustable.', 'This is in contrast to another common form of refinancing, “cash-out” refinancing, which refers to refinancing your existing loan into one with a higher balance to access your home equity as cash.', 'To decide whether refinancing is right for you — and which type of refinancing makes sense — it’s essential to understand how a rate-and-term refinance works.', 'In this article:', 'Rate-and-term refinance: How it works', 'Rate-and-term refinance vs. cash-out refinance', 'Benefits of a rate-and-term refinance', 'Understanding the breakeven point', 'When to consider a rate-and-term refinance', 'When to avoid a rate-and-term refinance', 'How to qualify', 'FAQs', 'A rate-and-term refinance refers to a mortgage refinance based on the outstanding balance of your loan. It’s probably what you think of as a standard refinance.', 'Your new mortgage will likely have a different mortgage rate, and you will start with a new loan term, such as a 15-year or 30-year mortgage. In addition, you may choose to refinance into a new type of loan, such as refinancing from an FHA loan to a conventional loan or from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage.', 'Learn more: 5 ways to prepare for a refinance', 'While both rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing involve replacing your existing mortgage with a new home loan, there are differences between the two processes.', 'The main distinction between a rate-and-term refinance and a cash-out refinance is that you are not tapping into your home equity with a rate-and-term refinance. Instead, you’re refinancing into a loan that might have a lower balance since you will have paid off some of the mortgage principal on your previous home loan. Your new balance depends on how long you have been making payments on your mortgage.', 'Cash-out refinancing gives you access to your home equity in the form of a larger mortgage, typically up to a maximum of 80% of your home value. Generally, a cash-out refinance will have a slightly higher mortgage rate than a rate-and-term refinance since lenders take on extra risk when you borrow more money.', 'Generally, rate-and-term refinancing is more popular when interest rates decline since borrowers want to take advantage of reduced mortgage rates and potentially lower their monthly mortgage payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that cash-out refinancing was more popular than rate-and-term refinancing when rates were rising.', 'In addition to these two common types of mortgage refinancing, some borrowers with FHA, VA, and USDA loans are eligible for streamline refinancing that requires less paperwork. Occasionally, borrowers opt for “cash-in” refinancing, which means they pay money at closing to lower their loan balance for the new loan.', 'The main benefit of a rate-and-term refinance is the ability to take advantage of lower mortgage rates to reduce the interest you pay on your home loan. However, you can accomplish other goals with a rate-and-term refinance even if mortgage refinance rates are not lower than when you first took out your current loan.', 'Here are some goals you could accomplish with a rate-and-term refinance:', 'Lower monthly payments toward your principal and interest. Your monthly payments will be smaller if you qualify for a lower interest rate. Even if mortgage rates are not significantly lower, you may be able to reduce your monthly payment if you have substantially paid down your loan balance and choose another 30-year mortgage term.', 'Build equity faster. Shortening your mortgage loan term from 30 years to 20, 15, or 10 years can accelerate your loan payoff date and build equity more quickly.', 'Eliminate mortgage insurance. Suppose your home has increased in value or you have paid down the balance, so you have at least 20% equity. In that case, you can lower your monthly payment even more by refinancing into a conventional loan and ending private mortgage insurance (PMI) payments. Remember that you don’t necessarily need to refinance to get rid of PMI. Your lender should have a process to cancel it when you have enough equity.', 'Reduce the overall interest you pay. If you lower your mortgage rate or shorten your loan term, you can spend significantly less on mortgage interest over the life of your loan, depending on the balance and the difference in rate.', 'Switch your mortgage loan type. FHA loans generally require you to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the entire loan term, so you may want to consider refinancing into a conventional mortgage to remove FHA insurance premiums. If you have an ARM and are worried about mortgage rates rising, you could choose a fixed-rate loan for payment certainty.', 'Dig deeper: How to get the lowest mortgage rates', 'You can use a mortgage calculator to estimate the monthly payments on a rate-and-term refinance, but you’ll also need to find out from a lender how much your refinance will cost. Generally, closing costs for a rate term refinance are 2% to 5% of your loan amount, and you may have the option to roll those costs into the new mortgage. You can shop around and talk to various mortgage lenders to compare loan costs.', 'If your rate-and-term refinance saves you money on your monthly payments, determine how long it will take to make up for the money you spent on your closing costs. For example, if your closing costs are $8,000 on a $400,000 mortgage loan and you are saving $250 monthly on your mortgage payment, it will take 32 months to recoup the $8,000. In this case, 32 months is your breakeven point.', 'Your breakeven point is an important calculation because if you think you will sell your property before you recoup your closing costs, it may not make sense to refinance.', 'Several scenarios may make it advantageous to apply for a rate-and-term refinance, such as:', 'Mortgage rates have dropped below your current rate.', 'Your credit score has improved, and you can qualify for a better mortgage rate.', 'Your income has increased, and/or your debt is lower, so you can qualify for a lower mortgage rate.', 'You have paid down your loan balance significantly and want to reduce your monthly mortgage payments or pay off your house faster.', 'You have cash flow issues or anticipate a tighter budget, so you may benefit from refinancing into a new 30-year loan with lower payments.', 'You expect your ARM rate to increase and would rather lock in a rate with a fixed-rate mortgage.', 'You want to change your loan term to coordinate the payoff date with your anticipated retirement.', 'While a rate-and-term refinance can benefit you in many ways, there are times when it may not be the best decision, such as the following:', 'Mortgage rates are substantially higher than your current rate. A mortgage calculator can estimate your new payment at current rates based on your remaining loan balance and the closing costs to see if refinancing is beneficial.', 'You plan to sell your home soon. Because refinancing is expensive, it rarely makes sense if you plan to move within a year or two.', 'If you apply for a rate-and-term refinance, you’ll need to qualify based on a lender’s guidelines. The process is generally similar to applying for any other mortgage.', 'Most mortgage lenders require a minimum credit score of 620 or higher for a rate-and-term refinance, although you will qualify for a lower rate on a conventional loan if your credit score is higher. Lenders typically require a debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which compares your minimum monthly payments on recurring debt with your gross monthly income, to be 50% or less, preferably under 43%.', 'Your lender will also review your income, assets, credit history, and home value. Most lenders prefer that you have at least 20% in home equity to refinance, although there are loans out there available for homeowners with less equity. If you have less than 20% equity, you will need to pay mortgage insurance on the loan.', 'Generally, you need to wait at least 12 months after the closing on your original mortgage to apply for a rate-and-term refinance.', 'Yes, many mortgage lenders allow you to roll your closing costs into your refinance so the amount is instead added to your new mortgage principal.', 'With a rate-and-term refinance, you are refinancing the remaining balance of your current loan. With a cash-out refinance, you access the equity in your home and add it to the remainder of your current loan, which means your total loan balance will increase.', 'Conventional lenders typically prefer you to have at least 20% in home equity for a rate-and-term refinance. FHA lenders allow you to refinance one FHA loan into another or a conventional loan into an FHA loan with just 2.25% in home equity. However, you would be required to pay mortgage insurance for the entire loan term.', 'This article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley']\n"

      "['Inflation has been all over the news over the last couple of years. Even if you’re not tired of hearing about it, you’re probably sick of higher prices at the grocery store and gas pump.', 'As of March 2024, the U.S. inflation rate was 3.5% for the previous 12 months. Although inflation has cooled following the 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022, it’s still above the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%, which it considers ideal for employment and stable prices.', 'Not only can inflation negatively impact the economy as a whole, but it can also make it tough for the average consumer to save. Let’s take a closer look at how inflation affects savings and what you can do to combat it.', 'Inflation measures the price increase of goods and services over a set period of time — usually a year. If inflation is high, that means the price of goods and services is growing quickly. If inflation is low, prices are growing slowly.', 'Inflation is measured by dividing the change in the price of a product or service (or a group of products or services) by the starting price, and then multiplying that number by 100. Here’s the formula:', 'Inflation Rate = ((B-A)/A) x 100', 'For example, say you want to know the inflation rate of a carton of eggs over the last year. If eggs cost $4 now and were $3.50 a year ago, you can calculate the inflation rate with the following equation:', '($4 - $3.50) / $3.50 x 100 = 14.29%', 'However, inflation generally refers to more than the price of eggs. The inflation rate typically measures the overall change in price for a broad group of goods and services — things like groceries, healthcare, and utilities, for example. Economists measure this with different price indexes. The most common is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, which includes commodities such as housing, food, transportation, household supplies, and healthcare.', 'You can think of inflation as a measure of your purchasing power. Over time, prices inflate, and your dollars don’t go as far. In other words, you need more money to buy the same goods and services.', 'Say, for example, you used to spend $100 at the grocery store. That $100 covered your groceries for the entire week. Now, buying those same groceries costs $115. You’re not buying anything new, but your $100 doesn’t go as far as it used to.', 'Inflation negatively impacts your savings in a couple of different ways. In the short term, inflation can make it harder to contribute to savings; if you have to spend more to cover your basic needs, you’ll have less money to save.', 'Inflation can also erode the value of your savings over time. If you keep money in a traditional savings account — or in cash, for that matter — it’ll lose purchasing power over time because your interest earnings (if any) won’t keep up with inflation. So, what you save today won’t go as far in the future.', 'When inflation is high, your savings need to earn a highly competitive interest rate in order to keep up. Otherwise, your reserves effectively shrink over time.', 'Read more: What is the average savings by age?', 'While high inflation can be bad news for your savings, there are a few things you can do to protect your money. Use the following tips to minimize inflation’s negative impact on your personal finances:', 'Choose a high-yield savings account: When inflation is high, it’s important to keep your savings in accounts that outpace inflation. Luckily, high inflation often leads to higher savings interest rates. To get the best rates, you’ll need to find a high-yield savings account, some of which have rates above 5%.', 'Consider CDs: Certificates of deposit (CDs) tend to offer higher returns than savings accounts and lock in your interest rate for a set period of time, known as the term. But there’s a catch: You can’t touch your money until the CD matures, otherwise, you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you can afford to lock up some savings for a while, you can earn a highly competitive interest rate for the duration of your CD’s term, even if rates drop.', 'Build an emergency fund: In response to high inflation, interest rates can rise, making it more expensive to borrow money. That’s why having an emergency savings fund is helpful. If your car breaks down or your water heater gives out, you can cover the cost without taking on expensive debt.', 'Invest: The higher the inflation rate, the faster your cash loses value sitting in a bank account. Historically, investing — while not without risk — can lead to higher returns. This can enable you to continue building wealth during inflationary periods.', 'Check your spending: Inflation makes it easy to spend more without noticing. So, it never hurts to check in with your budget. If you haven’t been able to save, you may decide to cut back on discretionary spending until you have a little more breathing room.']\n"

      "[\"Zelle is a peer-to-peer money transfer service that allows you to transfer money directly to another person's bank account, often within minutes.\", \"If you're looking for a free way to send instant transfers to your loved ones, here's what you need to know about how Zelle works and the safety features it uses to protect your information.\", 'Zelle is a money transfer app that lets you quickly send or request money from friends and family members. However, Zelle works a bit differently than similar apps, such as Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal.', \"In particular, Zelle works directly with banks and credit unions, allowing you to access the service through your financial institution's mobile app. If either party's bank doesn't partner with Zelle, you can download the Zelle app to use the service by linking an eligible Visa or Mastercard debit card.\", \"When you send money to someone who's already enrolled with Zelle, the money will go directly to their bank account, usually within minutes. If they aren't enrolled, Zelle will send them a notification via email or text message — depending on which information you used to identify them — explaining how they can enroll and receive the money.\", \"Note that Zelle also works with small businesses, but only if the customer's bank partners with Zelle. The option isn't available if you're using the Zelle app.\", \"If you're looking for a new way to send and request money instantly, here are the steps you'll take to get started.\", \"Zelle currently partners with more than 2,000 financial institutions nationwide, ranging from national banks to community banks and credit unions. To find out if your financial institution works with Zelle, you can check your bank's mobile app or Zelle's database of banking partners.\", 'If your financial institution partners with Zelle, you can typically enroll in the service in your banking mobile app using your email address or phone number.', \"If your banking app doesn't have the Zelle feature, you can download the Zelle app and enroll with your phone number and an eligible Visa or Mastercard debit card.\", \"Whether you're sending or requesting money, you can select people from your list or add a new person using their phone number or email address. You can even give Zelle access to your phone's contact list and look up friends or family members that way.\", 'Next, you\\'ll enter the amount you want to send to or request from the other person. Tap on \"Review,\" and you can confirm the amount and include a message.', \"Once you complete the transaction, the other person will receive a notification. If they're already enrolled with Zelle, the money you send will be transferred to their linked bank account within minutes. If you request money, they'll receive a notification to approve the transaction, after which you'll receive the money within minutes.\", \"If the other person isn't enrolled in Zelle, they'll receive details on how to enroll so they can receive or send the funds.\", 'Read more: 5 ways to transfer money from one bank to another', 'Zelle is owned by Early Warning Services, LLC, which is a joint venture between seven of the largest banks in the U.S.: Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo.', 'As such, you can expect Zelle to use top-of-the-line authentication, encryption, and monitoring features to protect your personal information and keep your payments secure.', \"That said, the only time you can cancel a payment made with Zelle is if the recipient hasn't yet enrolled with the service. If you've fallen victim to a scam or someone has managed to use the service without your permission, you'd need to report it to your bank or credit union.\", \"Additionally, Zelle doesn't offer any kind of purchase protection for transactions with small businesses.\", 'Read more: Are online banks really safe?', 'In some ways, Zelle offers a better way to transfer money than other peer-to-peer payment services. However, there are also some drawbacks to consider before using it.', \"Free instant transfers: Zelle doesn't charge fees for using its service, and as long as both you and the recipient are enrolled, the transfer occurs within minutes. In contrast, other money transfer services only allow you to send money on their platforms, and transferring funds to your bank account for free can take a day or longer. If you want instant access to your funds, you'll typically have to pay a fee of up to 1.75% of the transfer amount.\", \"Widely accessible: Zelle works directly with more than 2,000 banks and credit unions, making it accessible to more than 100 million people directly through their mobile banking apps. Even if your financial institution doesn't partner with Zelle, you can still take advantage of fast transfers with the Zelle mobile app and an eligible debit card.\", \"Balance protection: Because Zelle transfers money directly between users' bank accounts, there's no option to maintain a balance with Zelle that's separate from your bank account. Venmo, PayPal and Cash App all offer this option, but most money held within a money transfer app isn't protected by federal deposit insurance, which covers bank and credit union balances.\", \"Limited functionality: Zelle only allows person-to-person transfers between U.S. bank accounts. If you want to add a credit card to make payments or send money to someone internationally, you'll need to use another payment app.\", \"No payment protection: Zelle doesn't offer any payment protection beyond the option to cancel a payment to an unenrolled recipient. That's fairly standard for other money transfer apps, too. But if you're transacting with a business, consider using Venmo or PayPal, both of which offer purchase protection on eligible business-related payments.\", \"Requires a bank account: Zelle only works if you have a U.S. checking or savings account. Unfortunately, 6% of adults in the U.S. don't have a bank account, according to the Federal Reserve. Other payment apps allow you to transact without a bank account, albeit with some limitations and even offer their own debit cards you can use.\", \"Zelle offers a quick way to send money to friends and family members, and if that's all you need, it can be a solid alternative to other money transfer apps. However, there are some limitations, particularly with payment protection, functionality, and bank account requirements.\", 'To determine if Zelle is right for you, consider your needs and preferences. Depending on the situation, it could make sense to use multiple payment services to meet all of your needs.']\n"

Instead of tracking multiple categories or rotating bonus calendars, you'll earn a flat rewards rate on most purchases.\", 'Annual fee: $0 for the first year; after that, $95 per year', 'Welcome offer: Earn 50,000 miles after spending at least $4,500 within the first three months', 'Rewards: Earn 2x miles per $1 spent on every purchase for your business and 5x miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel', 'Recommended credit score: Good to Excellent (670–850)', 'More details: Up to $100 in travel credits for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fees', 'During the first year, the annual fee for the Spark Miles card is $0. After that, the fee increases to $95 per year.', 'New card members can earn 50,000 miles after spending at least $4,500 on new purchases within three months of opening an account. Once you meet the spending requirement, Capital One will apply the bonus to your account within two billing cycles.', 'If you redeem that reward for travel arrangements booked through Capital One Travel, the new card member offer is worth up to $500.', 'Currently, there is no introductory APR promotion for the Capital One Spark Miles card.', 'Compared to other rewards cards, the Spark Miles for Business card has a relatively simple rewards structure:', '5x miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel', '2x miles per $1 spent on every business purchase', \"To maximize your rewards, book your work travel, such as hotel stays and car rentals, through the Capital One Travel platform; you'll earn five miles for every dollar spent.

When you redeem your miles through the Capital One Travel portal, each mile is worth one cent. For example, if you earn 20,000 miles, you could redeem them for $200 worth of flights, car rentals, or hotel accommodations.', 'Capital One allows you to transfer your points to its travel partners, including loyalty programs like Emirates Skywards or Finnair Plus. You can also redeem your miles in other ways, including gift cards or account credits, but the value of your points may be less with those redemption options.', 'Other benefits include:', 'Free employee cards: You can get free cards for your employees and earn rewards on their purchases. Plus, you can set spending limits on employee cards.', \"Lifestyle Collection: Use your card to book a stay with a hotel in the Lifestyle Collection, and you'll enjoy benefits like a $50 experience credit to use during your stay, room upgrades, and early check-in or late checkout (when available).\", 'Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit: Speed up your time in the airport security line by signing up for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.

You'll earn a higher rewards rate on hotels and car rentals and a flat rate on all other business purchases.\", 'The card provides added benefits and protections, and the $95 annual fee is relatively low for a card that offers so many perks.', 'No annual fee the first year: The annual fee is waived for the first year, giving you time to try out the card and earn rewards before deciding whether to keep it and pay the fee.', 'Simple rewards: Even the best rewards card can be incredibly complex, requiring users to keep track of rotating spending categories and special bonus offers. The Spark Miles card is much simpler, offering a flat rate on most purchases.', 'Added benefits: Card members enjoy benefits like extended warranty protection and Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee reimbursements.', \"Must have excellent credit: To qualify for the Spark Miles card, you must have excellent credit.

In fact, the average cost Americans incur for food at home is $5,703 each year — nearly $500 monthly.', 'With regular grocery bills that high, it pays — a lot — to have a grocery rewards credit card in your wallet. But these cards can widely vary when it comes to rewards structures, restrictions, and spending caps. To help you get started, we’ve rounded up the best credit cards for groceries today and how you can choose the right one for your supermarket sweeps.', 'Best grocery credit cards for May 2024', 'Best overall: Blue Cash Preferred', 'Best no annual fee and unlimited rewards: Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards', 'Best for travel rewards: American Express Gold', 'Best for max cash back: U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards', 'Best for no annual fee: Blue Cash Everyday', 'Best for regular monthly grocery spend: Citi Custom Cash', 'Grocery retail credit cards', 'Costco Anywhere Visa', 'Capital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard', 'Target Circle️ Card', 'Should you get a credit card for groceries?', 'Grocery reward limitations', 'Methodology', 'Annual fee: $95, waived to $0 for the first year (see rates and fees)', 'Welcome offer: Earn $250 after spending $3,000 within the first 6 months', 'Rewards:', '6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 spent per year)', '6% cash back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions', '3% cash back on transit (includes taxis, rideshares, parking, and more)', '3% cash back at U.S. gas stations', '1% cash back on all other purchases', 'More details: Blue Cash Preferred has an introductory 0% APR for both new purchases and balance transfers. It also has a few potentially valuable annual credits with partners. Earn up to $84 per year ($7 per month, with enrollment) when you spend at least $9.99 on an eligible Disney Bundle subscription and earn up to $120 in Equinox+ credits ($10 per month; with enrollment) when you pay for an auto-renewing subscription via equinoxplus.com.', 'Why we like it: At 6% cash back, the Blue Cash Preferred is the ultimate rewards card for U.S. supermarket shoppers. There is a $6,000 annual cap (after which you’ll earn 1% cash back in the category), which averages out to around $500 per month. If you have a large family and eat mostly at home, you may exceed that annual limit — but it is still within Americans’ average spending of just over $5,700. If you are able to meet the 6% spending limit, you’ll get up to $360 in cash back, far exceeding the card’s ongoing $95 annual fee.', 'The Amex Blue Cash Preferred can bring a lot of value to your other regular spending with additional cash-back categories for streaming, transit, and U.S. gas stations — as well as annual partner statement credits. Plus, you can enjoy plenty of outsized value over the first year between the waived annual fee, introductory 0% APR, and welcome bonus.', 'Annual fee: $0', 'Welcome offer: Earn $200 after spending $500 within the first 3 months', 'Rewards:', '5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel', '3% cash back on dining', '3% cash back on entertainment', '3% cash back on popular streaming services', '3% cash back at grocery stores', '1% cash back on all other purchases', 'More details: In addition to the rewards above, you’ll get 8% cash back on Capital One Entertainment purchases and 10% cash back rewards on Uber and Uber Eats purchases — plus complimentary Uber One membership (though Nov. 14, 2024). There’s also an introductory 0% APR on new purchases and balance transfers.', 'Why we like it: The Capital One SavorOne has a lot of potential value for shoppers who spend a lot on groceries. Unlike other cards on our list, there’s no cap to the amount of grocery purchases you can earn 3% cash back on each year. If you spend around the national average of $5,703, you can earn a total of $171.09 annually, even before accounting for your savings across other categories.', 'Those other categories make this no annual fee card a great option overall for anyone who budgets money for both staying in and going out, with the same 3% cash back on dining, streaming services, and entertainment (which includes concert tickets, amusement parks, movie theaters, and tourist attractions).', 'Annual fee: $250 (see rates and fees)', 'Welcome offer: Earn 60,000 points after spending $6,000 within the first 6 months', 'Rewards:', '4x points at restaurants worldwide', '4x points at U.S. supermarkets (up to $25,000 spent per year)', '3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or AmexTravel.com', '1x points on all other purchases', 'More details: The Amex Gold offers up to $120 in annual Uber Cash ($10 per month) when you connect your card through the Uber app. You can also get up to $120 in annual dining statement credits ($10 per month, with enrollment) toward purchases with Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, Milk Bar, and select Shake Shack locations. On top of that, get access to The Hotel Collection and a $100 experience credit when you book a minimum two-night stay through Amex Travel.', 'Why we like it: With 4x Membership Rewards bonus points at U.S. supermarkets, the American Express Gold Card is one of the best options for turning your grocery purchases into travel rewards. It’s unlikely that most shoppers will reach the $25,000 annual spending cap — which averages out to a monthly supermarket bill over $2,000. But if you do, you could earn a whopping 100,000 Membership Rewards points from this bonus category. If your supermarket purchases are closer to the average $5,703 annually, you can still rack up 22,812 points each year.', 'Beyond that, the Amex Gold can also help you maximize restaurant spending and flight purchases — in line with many other travel card options today. While it does carry a $250 annual fee (see rates and fees), the annual dining credits and Uber Cash cover nearly the entire cost. Just remember to think about whether you already spend that money each month. If you’re spending money simply to earn a monthly statement credit, you could end up paying more than you save over the long run.', 'Annual fee: $95, waived to $0 for the first year', 'Welcome offer: Earn $250 after spending $2,000 within the first 120 days', 'Rewards:', '6% cash back on your first $1,500 in combined spending each quarter with two choice retailers (choices include Apple, Amazon.com, Chewy.com, Ikea, Kohl’s, Target, Walmart, and many more)', '3% cash back on your first $1,500 spent each quarter in one choice everyday category (wholesale clubs, gas and EV charging stations, or bills and utilities)', '1.5% cash back on all other purchases', 'More details: There aren’t many added perks to this card, but you will save on the annual fee cost for the first year — after which this card has a $95 annual fee. You can also earn 5.5% cash back if you book prepaid hotels or car rentals through the U.S. Bank Rewards Travel Center.', 'Why we like it: This card takes some strategy to maximize, but the potential value of the U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards may be worth it. To start, you’ll earn 6% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined spending across two retailers you choose each quarter. Superstores like Target and Walmart are included among these choice retailers (unlike most grocery rewards cards), and this is a great option if you prefer to go grocery shopping there.', 'And that’s not all: The added option to choose wholesale clubs as your 3% category (up to $1,500 in spending each quarter) means you can further maximize your grocery spending up to $3,000 in purchases each quarter. Plus, you’ll earn a minimum of 1.5% cash back on all non-category spending, even after exceeding the quarterly spending limits.', 'But let’s say you just spend the average $5,703 each year on groceries, and fit all of your spending into the 6% category with merchants that sell groceries as your choice retailers. You’ll get a total $342.18 in cash back with this card each year — and even more if you take advantage of other categories.', 'Annual fee: $0 (see rates and fees)', 'Welcome offer: Earn $200 after spending $2,000 within the first 6 months', 'Rewards:', '3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets*', '3% cash back on U.S. online retail purchases*', '3% cash back at U.S. gas stations*', '1% cash back on all other purchases', '*Up to $6,000 in each category per year, then 1%; cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout', 'More details: Like the Blue Cash Preferred from Amex, the Blue Cash Everyday has a 0% intro APR on new purchases and balance transfers and comes with up to $84 in annual credits ($7 per month) when you spend at least $9.99 per month on an eligible auto-renewing Disney+ subscription. You can also get up to $180 per year ($15 per month) in statement credits toward an auto-renewing Home Chef subscription.', 'Why we like it: For no annual fee (see rates and fees), the Amex Blue Cash Everyday’s 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets can translate to a big rewards return each year. There is a $6,000 annual cap (after which you’ll earn 1%) — but if you spend around the average $5,703 on groceries each year you’ll be able to maximize the category and get around $171.09 back.', 'If you also spend much of your monthly budget filling up the gas tank or shopping online, you can get even more value from this card. Each of these categories has the same $6,000 annual spending limit. If you reach the max across all three, that’s a potential $540 in annual cash back. Plus, if you already have subscriptions to Disney+ and Home Chef, count on more savings in the form of monthly statement credits.', 'Read our full review of the Blue Cash Everyday card', 'Annual fee: $0', 'Welcome offer: Earn $200 after spending $1,500 within the first 6 months', 'Rewards:', '5% cash back on your top eligible spending category each billing cycle (up to $500 in monthly purchases, then 1%)', '1% cash back on all other purchases', 'More details: Eligible spending categories for the 5% category include grocery stores as well as restaurants, gas stations, select streaming services, home improvement stores, and more. There’s also an intro 0% APR offer and you can earn 4% when you book hotels, car rentals, and attractions with Citi Travel through June 30, 2025.', 'Why we like it: This card is our choice for regular monthly grocery spending because it can be ideal for grocery shoppers who have a set amount of money to put toward groceries each month. There is a $500 monthly spending cap, but it’s hard to beat the 5% you can earn up to that limit with the Citi Custom Cash. Over a year of maxing out the 5% with grocery stores as your category, you can earn up to $300 cash back. With the average $5,703 spread over a year, you could potentially earn $285.15. Just be aware of your spending and spread your grocery purchases out to not meet the monthly caps.', 'Unlike some other customized cash-back credit cards, the Citi Custom Cash makes it easier to maximize these categories. Instead of opting into your choice category each billing cycle, you’ll automatically earn 5% on purchases in the eligible category where you spend most. So if you want to use this as your grocery rewards card, you may want to designate it solely for your regular trips to the supermarket to ensure you’re getting the max 5% rewards when you spend.', 'A co-branded grocery credit card may offer even more savings if you tend to shop at the same store each week. That’s especially true if you do most of your grocery shopping at superstores or wholesale clubs — which are often excluded from earning bonus rewards with regular grocery credit cards.', 'Here are a few store credit cards for groceries to consider:', 'For no annual fee beyond your Costco membership price, you can use the Costco Anywhere Visa to earn 4% cash back on eligible gas station and EV charging station purchases (up to $7,000 per year, then 1%), 3% cash back at restaurants, 3% cash back on eligible travel spending, and 2% cash back on purchases at Costco and Costco.com. Everything else earns 1% cash back. If you already have a Costco membership and do much of your monthly shopping there, this card can help you maximize that grocery spending as well as other regular expenses.', 'However, you will redeem your Costco card rewards differently than other cash-back credit cards. Each year, you’ll receive a rewards certificate which you can use in one transaction at a Costco warehouse location. As with any card, ensure you understand the details of how to best earn and use your rewards before you sign up.', 'Related: How to save on travel with your Costco credit card', 'If you do most of your grocery shopping (and other essentials) at Walmart, the Capital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard could offer big savings. It has no annual fee and earns 5% cash back on Walmart.com purchases (which includes pickup and delivery orders) and 2% cash back on purchases at Walmart stores and both Murphy USA and Walmart gas stations. You’ll also get 2% cash back at restaurants, 2% cash back on travel, and 1% on all other purchases.', 'For the first 12 months after account opening, you can earn a boosted 5% cash back in-store at Walmart when you use Walmart Pay with your card to make your purchases.', 'Target recently revamped its Target Circle rewards program — and part of the relaunch included the Target Circle Card, which offers a lot of potential savings for frequent shoppers. You’ll earn 5% cash back at Target stores and on Target.com with the no annual fee card and, if you’re approved for the Target Mastercard version, also earn 2% cash back on dining, 2% at gas stations, and 1% cash back on all other non-Target purchases.', 'Other Target benefits include free two-day shipping on eligible purchases, a longer window for returns or exchanges, and other deals for cardholders that vary throughout the year. As a bonus, you can get $50 toward a future purchase after you’re approved.', 'Ready more: Target Circle 360 vs. Walmart+ and Amazon Prime', 'Keeping multiple credit cards in your wallet can be useful for earning the best rewards and taking advantage of the best benefits on nearly every purchase you make. So if, like many Americans, supermarket spending is among your most common monthly expenses — a credit card for groceries can make a lot of sense.', 'There are a few reasons you may want to hold off, though. For one, if opening a new credit card encourages you to spend more than you can afford just to earn rewards, it might be more costly than budget-friendly. Many of the best grocery credit cards also require a great credit score — so if you’re still building a solid credit history, you may want to wait to apply.', 'Overall, comparing the potential value to your own spending at the grocery store is the best way to decide. Here are a few more factors to consider:', 'Where you shop most often: If you always do your grocery shopping at the same chain, or a rotation of a few different supermarkets, make sure you can earn rewards there with your grocery credit card. Read the card’s terms before you apply to see whether any exclusions apply that may keep you from maximizing your spending.', 'What type of rewards you want to earn: You can find grocery bonus categories among both cash-back credit cards and rewards credit cards that earn points and miles. Narrow down your options by deciding whether you prefer the simplicity of cash back or want to earn points that you can put toward a future travel purchase.', 'How much you spend on groceries: Several of the best credit cards for groceries cap the amount you can spend before maxing out top rewards for the month, quarter, or year. Look back at your total supermarket spending over the past year to compare your totals with each card’s spending cap to secure the most value for you over the long term.', 'Like any credit card bonus category, the details of your grocery rewards can differ between cards and card issuers.', 'The language used by the issuer to refer to a card’s grocery rewards can make a big difference in your potential earnings.', 'For example, many grocery credit cards earn rewards solely at “grocery stores” or “supermarkets” and specify that the same bonus rewards rate does not apply to large superstores like Walmart and Target or warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club. If you prefer to complete all your shopping at your local Super Target or you’re a loyal Costco member, you’ll probably be better off with a card that earns rewards at those stores specifically.', 'This is also important if you use online grocery delivery. Whether you prefer Instacart, Amazon Fresh, or another grocery delivery service, you’ll want to make sure you can earn your grocery rewards while using it.', 'Finally, look for any restrictions on where you spend. Some grocery credit cards only earn rewards at stores within the United States. If you plan to use the card to buy food on trips abroad, you might forfeit some rewards earnings.', 'Spending limits are likely one of the first things that stand out when you begin comparing credit cards for groceries. You’ll often see a card offer something like 5% cash back on grocery store purchases up to the first $500 per month or 6% back on grocery store spending up to the first $1,500 per quarter.', 'While a spending cap can hurt your potential earnings, it’s not a reason to rule out a card altogether. In fact, the cards we compared generally have spending limits well within the amount average Americans spend on food at home each year.', 'What’s more important is how each card’s restrictions fit your specific grocery spending.', 'If you have a large family, for example, and spend well beyond the limits each year, you might want to look for a card that doesn’t have any annual limit on what you can earn — even if it does have a lower reward or cash-back rate. Or maybe your grocery spending tends to be much higher at certain times throughout the year when you eat at home more. Then, you might prioritize a card with a more flexible annual limit rather than specific monthly or quarterly limits.', 'Our list of the best credit cards for groceries started by compiling all of the credit cards available from major issuers — from cash-back cards to rewards and travel credit cards — that earn grocery rewards. In total, we evaluated nearly three dozen cards for this list.', 'From there, we determined each credit card’s annual grocery rewards potential based on the average amount that Americans spend on food at home according to the Consumer Expenditures survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of 2022 — the most recent available data — that amount is $5,703.', 'We then assigned each of the potential cards a rating. The data points used for this include standard details like APR, annual fee, welcome bonus, security protections, and more. But we also included some features specific to grocery rewards, including the potential cash back earned using the BLS data and actual rewards rate.', 'The cards that make up our list include both the top-scoring cards overall and the cards with the top potential annual earnings. While we wanted to guarantee each of our options could help maximize grocery spending, we also included a range of annual fees, rewards types, and spending limits so that you can use your individual spending habits and goals to find the best fit for your grocery budget.', 'This article was edited by Rebecca McCracken', \"Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

While many financial products and services exist to help you wrangle your business finances, the right credit card can be an invaluable tool.', 'If you’re in the market for a new business card, the PayPal Business Cashback Mastercard® is a straightforward option. With helpful perks and a simple rewards program, this card can make it easier to manage your business spending.', 'Annual fee: $0', 'Welcome offer: N/A', 'Rewards: Unlimited 3% cash back on PayPal purchases, and 2% cash back on all other purchases', 'The PayPal Business credit card has an APR ranging from 18.49% to 29.99%, depending on your creditworthiness.', 'You won’t pay an annual fee with the PayPal Business Cashback card, which lets you keep more money in your business bank account.', 'Unlike some cash-back credit cards on the market, the PayPal Business Cashback card doesn’t have a welcome offer.', 'This card does not offer a 0% introductory APR on new purchases or balance transfers; its regular APR will apply immediately.', '3% cash back on PayPal purchases', '2% cash back on all other purchases', 'With this card, you won’t need to worry about planning your spending or rotating categories. Instead, your business can earn unlimited 3% cash back on PayPal purchases and 2% unlimited cash back on all other business purchases.', 'PayPal gives you the option to redeem your rewards as a statement credit, and you can also deposit them into your linked PayPal account. You’ll need at least $1 worth of rewards to redeem them.', 'Upon approval for the PayPal Business Card, you may get access to a virtual card you can use immediately via your PayPal Business Account. You won’t pay extra for employee cards with this card, and you can customize users’ spending limits for convenience and added peace of mind. Benefits also include cellphone and identity theft protection, as well as two-year extended warranty coverage.', 'Further, it’s possible in-store purchases could qualify for the higher 3% cash-back rate, provided that retailers accept payments via QR code through the PayPal app.', 'To qualify for the PayPal Business Cashback card, you’ll need to be in business for at least a year, have a PayPal Business Account, and make over $5,000 in annual revenue. Beyond its qualification requirements, this card is best for frequent PayPal users, as its rewards rate is highest for purchases made through that service. Another card might be a better choice if your business depends on another payment service to buy goods and services.', 'Decent, straightforward cash-back rewards', 'Virtual card may be used immediately upon approval', 'No annual fee', 'Free employee cards', 'Cell phone protection', 'Extended warranty coverage', 'New business owners may not qualify', 'No 0% introductory APR', 'No welcome offer', 'PayPal Business Account required', 'Not available to businesses in North Dakota and South Dakota', \"The PayPal Business Cashback card is a Mastercard, so you can use it anywhere Mastercards are accepted, including internationally. You won't pay a foreign transaction fee with this card.\", 'Online: You can pay online through your PayPal account', 'By mail: Mail a check to the address on your credit card statements.', 'Phone number: 1-866-300-6432, available 24/7', 'PayPal Business Cashback card login page', 'If you frequently use a PayPal Business Account to make purchases, the PayPal Business Cashback card could be a decent choice. That said, some competitor cards offer a longer list of perks. Here are some alternatives worth considering if the PayPal Business Cashback card doesn’t seem right for you.', 'Why we like it:', 'The Chase Ink Business Cash Credit Card has no annual fee like the PayPal Business Cash Card, but its generous welcome bonus sets it apart— card members can earn $750 cash back after they spend $6,000 in the first three months.', 'This card’s reward structure is slightly more complicated than the PayPal Business Cashback card, but redemptions are also more flexible. You can get up to 5% cash back each cardmember year on $25,000 spent at office supply stores and on internet, cable, and phone services; 5% back on Lyft rides through March 2025; 2% cash back on $25,000 spent at gas stations and restaurants; and 1% cash back on all other purchases.', 'You can use your cash back for several purposes, including cash, travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, gift cards, and more.', 'Why we like it:', 'Fortunately, you don’t need to choose between a card with a welcome offer and one with simple rewards because the Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card has both. As a card member, you can earn $750 cash back after spending $6,000 in the first three months.', 'And you won’t need to worry about tracking categories or rewards caps, either. You simply earn 1.5% unlimited cash back on all your business purchases, and you can redeem your rewards for cash, gift cards, travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards, and more. The Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card also has a $0 annual fee.', 'Why we like it:', 'The American Express Blue Business Cash Card also has a $0 annual fee and a welcome offer with a fairly low minimum spend requirement—you can earn a $250 statement credit once you spend $3,000 in the first three months. As a card member, you’ll also get 2% cash back on up to $50,000 worth of business purchases each calendar year, and 1% cash back after that (cash back is applied as a statement credit automatically; see rates and fees, terms apply.)', 'In addition to its welcome offer and simple rewards, this card offers a 0% introductory APR on purchases for 12 months after account opening (18.49% – 26.49% variable APR after that). This can be helpful if you’re planning a big business purchase and need some extra time to pay off your balance.', 'This article was edited by Rebecca McCracken', \"Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

You can use your miles for United flights, seat upgrades, and more. Depending on how you redeem your miles, the welcome offer could be worth $200 or more.', 'Get an introductory 0% APR for 12 months, after which the standard APR applies. This intro APR applies to new purchases only, not balance transfers from other credit cards.', '2x miles on United purchases', '2x miles at gas stations', '2x miles on local transit and commuting', '1x miles on all other purchases', 'You’ll get bonus rewards from qualifying United purchases made with your card, but it also offers 2x miles in popular categories like gas stations and local transit costs.

You can also redeem your miles for a statement credit when you book a flight using your card. While the card doesn’t reimburse you for TSA Precheck membership fees, as some premium travel cards do, you can use your United miles to cover the cost.', 'Notably, United is part of the Star Alliance, which has more than 25 partner airlines. That means you can use your MileagePlus miles to book travel with partners such as Air Canada, Avianca, and Lufthansa.', 'When you use your card for eligible United purchases, including in-flight food, drinks, and Wi-Fi, and premium drinks at United Club locations, you’ll get 25% back as a statement credit.', 'There’s no foreign transaction fee with the United Gateway Card, so you won’t need to worry about additional costs when you make purchases abroad.', 'You’ll get a complimentary DoorDash DashPass membership for one year when you use your United Gateway Card to activate your membership before the end of 2024.', 'As an introductory airline card, the United Gateway Card could be a good fit for those who fly United occasionally and don’t want to pay an annual fee. It offers a few perks like a welcome bonus, introductory APR on new purchases, and 25% back as a statement credit on qualifying United in-flight purchases.', 'More frequent United fliers may benefit more from its sister card, the United Explorer, as it provides a broader range of benefits for a reasonable annual fee.', 'Easy-to-earn welcome offer', 'No annual fee', 'Promotional 0% APR for 12 months on purchases', 'Partial statement credit for eligible United in-flight and United Club purchases', 'Relatively few added perks', 'No introductory APR on balance transfers', 'Welcome offer is relatively small', 'The United Gateway Card is part of the Visa network, so it’s accepted almost everywhere in the world. The Visa network is available in over 200 countries and territories globally.', 'You pay your United Gateway card balance through these channels:', 'Online via your United Gateway credit card account', 'Phone: 1-800-537-7783', 'Mail:\\nCardmember Services\\nP.O.

Here are some great travel card alternatives to the United Gateway Card.', 'Why we like it: The United Explorer Card offers more perks than its little sister, the United Gateway. With the Explorer card, you can earn 50,000 bonus miles if you spend $3,000 in the first three months. You’ll also get 2x miles on eligible United purchases, direct hotel bookings, and dining out; and 1x miles on all other purchases.', 'Beyond that, you and a companion will benefit from a free checked bag on United flights booked with your card, along with other benefits like priority boarding and a statement credit of up to $100 for Global Entry, TSA PreCheck® or NEXUS membership every 4 years. This card has an intro annual fee of $0 for your first cardholder year, then a $95 annual fee afterward.', 'Read our full review of the United Explorer Card', 'Why we like it: If you’d prefer a travel card with more flexibility, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great option. This card has a relatively small $95 annual fee, but it comes with lucrative benefits to easily offset this cost.', 'New card members can earn 75,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points when they spend $4,000 or more within the first three months. Those points are worth 25% more when you use them for bookings through Chase travel. As a cardholder, you’ll also get 5x points on eligible Lyft rides through March 2025 and on qualifying purchases through Chase Travel; 3x points on dining out, at online grocery stores, and on select streaming services; 2x points on other travel purchases; and 1x points on everything else.', 'Read our full review of the Sapphire Preferred', 'Why we like it: Like the Chase Sapphire Preferred, the Capital One Venture Rewards Card has an affordable $95 annual fee — but its reward structure is simpler. Cardholders can earn 5x miles on hotel and rental car purchases through Capital One Travel, and 2x miles on all other purchases.', 'This card also comes with a profitable early spend bonus: 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 in the first three months. This bonus is worth around $750. With the Capital One Venture Rewards, you’ll get a statement credit of up to $100 for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, which can help you speed through security at the airport.', 'This article was edited by Alicia Hahn', \"Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

The cards are even partially made using metal from the two planes. This limited-edition card design is available for both new and existing cardholders through June 5, 2024.', 'If you opt for the Delta Boeing card design, you’ll get all regular features of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve, which was revamped earlier this year. As the most premium of Delta’s co-branded cards with Amex, this card has plenty of perks for Delta frequent fliers, including an annual companion certificate, airport lounge access, annual credits, savings on award bookings, and many more.', 'Read our full review of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Card', 'It’s time for a last call on one of the largest hotel credit card bonuses available today: The IHG One Rewards Premier Business Credit Card 175,000-point offer.', 'If you want to earn the full amount, you’ll need a relatively large budget for your business spending. First, earn 140,000 bonus points after you spend at least $4,000 within the first three months, then earn another 35,000 bonus points after spending a total of $7,000 within the first six months.', 'If you’re considering this card for your business expenses, now is your last chance to earn this welcome bonus — which runs until the end of May 15, 2024.', 'Those 175,000 bonus points can offer great savings for business travelers who prefer staying at IHG properties. And even after the bonus, you can maximize each of your IHG hotel stays with 26x points at IHG Hotels and Resorts when you use the $99 annual fee IHG One Rewards Premier Business card.', 'You’ll also earn 5x points in select non-hotel spending categories, including gas stations, select advertising, travel, and restaurants. More benefits include an Anniversary Free Night and status within the IHG One loyalty program.', 'If you’re a dedicated online grocery shopper, the Instacart Mastercard® could offer a lot of savings on your weekly haul. You can maximize your Instacart purchases even more with the highest welcome offer available for the Instacart Mastercard today: an automatic $100 Instacart credit and a free year of Instacart+ membership.', 'This no-annual-fee cash-back credit card earns 5% cash back on purchases through the Instacart app and Instacart.com, plus:', '5% on travel through Chase Travel', '2% at restaurants, gas stations, and on select streaming services', '1% on all other purchases', 'Perks of the complimentary Instacart+ membership include unlimited free delivery on orders over $35, lower service fees, and other member-only savings. Members save an average of $7 per order, according to Instacart. After your free year, membership auto-renews. The current membership price is $99 per year or $9.99 per month, which Instacart says will pay for itself in benefits if you order at least twice per month.', 'Adding to a year filled with great co-branded travel card welcome bonuses, this limited-time offer could help you save big on upcoming international travel with three European airlines.', 'When you open an Aer Lingus Visa Signature® Card, British Airways Visa Signature® Card, or Iberia Visa Signature® Card today, you can earn 85,000 Avios after spending $5,000 within the first three months. That’s 10,000 Avios (like other airlines’ points and miles, Avios are your rewards currency) more than the cards previously offered: 75,000 Avios after spending the same $5,000 within three months.', 'Each of these Avios-earning cards has a $95 annual fee and earns 3x Avios per dollar spent with any of the three airlines — along with bonus points in select everyday and travel categories. Depending on which card you choose, you’ll also get airline-specific discounts, credits, and more depending on which card you choose depending on which card you choose.', 'Avios are automatically deposited into the loyalty program account associated with your card: Aer Lingus AerClub, British Airways Executive Club, or Iberia Plus. You can use your rewards toward reward flights with the airline and its partners, flight upgrades, hotel and car rental reservations, and more.', 'This article was edited by Rebecca McCracken', \"Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

      "['The man at the center of the pandemic meme stock craze appeared online for the first time in three years, sending the prices of the quirky and volatile shares sharply higher Monday.', 'Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” posted an image Sunday on the social platform X of a man sitting forward in his chair, a meme used by gamers when things are getting serious.', 'He followed that tweet with a YouTube video from years before when he championed the beleaguered company GameStop saying, “That’s all for now cuz I’m out of breath. FYI here’s a quick 4min video I put together to summarize the $GME bull case.”', 'GameStop in 2021 was a video game retailer that was struggling to survive as consumers switched rapidly from discs to digital downloads. Big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock, believing that its shares would continue on a drastically downward trend.', 'Gill and those who agreed with him changed the trajectory of a company that appeared to headed for bankruptcy by buying up thousands of GameStop shares in the face of almost any accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble.', 'That began what is known as a “short squeeze,” when those big investors that had bet against GameStop were forced to buy its rapidly rising stock to offset their massive losses.', \"At Monday's opening bell it appeared that Gill had reignited the phenomenon as shares of GameStop more than doubled. They closed Monday up 74%. It's the biggest intraday trading jump for GameStop since the meme craze of early 2021. Other meme stocks like the theater chain AMC were jolted higher as well.\", 'Trading in GameStop was halted eight times before noon on Monday due to volatility.', 'Gill became a cause célèbre in 2021 after his posts on the Reddit subcategory Wallstreetbets ignited a David vs. Goliath battle with large hedge funds that were betting heavily against the survival of GameStop.', 'The small guys won, at least for a while, driving shares of GameStop up more than 1,000% in 2021 and other meme stocks as well. The struggling movie theater chain AMC jumped 2,300% in a very short span of time in the same year.', 'Some big traders posted colossal losses as GameStop raced from less than $20, to close to $400 each. Citron Research, Melvin Capital and other well-known hedge funds lost an estimated $5 billion, according to analytics firm S3 Partners.', 'Some of those new and smaller investors believed, at least in part, that Ryan Cohen, co-founder of Chewy.com, could push the traditional retailer in a more online direction. Cohen built up a stake in GameStop before eventually joining the board and last year becoming its CEO.']\n"

She advised against the intuitive choice of withdrawing from regular savings or Roth IRA accounts first.', 'Instead, she suggested prioritizing withdrawals from accounts that impose tax implications, like traditional or rollover IRAs. \"You are not making that much money,\" Orman explained, pointing out that Ellen’s primary income comes from her Social Security, which is tax-free under her current financial conditions.', 'Ellen’s situation, Orman noted, positions her advantageously for tapping into her traditional or rollover IRA accounts. By doing so, Ellen could potentially withdraw up to $15,000 a year without owing taxes, thanks to the standard deduction. This method maximizes the tax-free growth benefits of her Roth IRA, allowing those funds to accumulate interest longer, potentially increasing her financial stability in later years.', 'Trending: If the United States had access to today’s high-yield savings accounts rates in 2015, it wouldn’t need to save another penny.', 'KT, Orman’s co-host, admitted to leaning toward simpler withdrawal strategies, underscoring the complexity and importance of informed financial planning in retirement. Orman’s expert advice not only addressed Ellen’s query but also educated listeners on the nuanced decisions retirees must navigate to optimize their financial resources.', 'Traditional financial experts often recommend several strategies for withdrawing retirement funds, which can contrast with the specific advice given by Suze Orman. The most commonly cited strategy is the 4% rule, suggesting that retirees withdraw 4% of their retirement portfolio in the first year, adjusting annually for inflation to ensure the fund lasts at least 30 years. However, Suze has called this move \"very dangerous\" in today\\'s economic climate.', 'By understanding the tax implications and growth potential of different retirement accounts, retirees like Ellen can make informed decisions that enhance their financial longevity and stability.']\n"

      "['Imagine that you’re 65 years old and just completed a Roth conversion during a low-tax year early in retirement to avoid future required minimum distributions (RMDs). However, not long after the conversion, you want to withdraw the money you just paid taxes on. But pursuing the withdrawal without first understanding the five-year rule for Roth IRAs could leave you paying income taxes and penalties on the money.', 'Need help planning your Roth conversion or navigating the five-year rule? Connect with a financial advisor today.', 'Would the rule apply to you in this situation? Unfortunately, the answer is the ever unsatisfying \"it depends.\" In fact, there are actually several five-year rules to be aware of with Roth IRAs. We\\'ll review two that would likely come into play and explore how they would impact your withdrawal strategy.', 'The first five-year rule, which applies to Roth IRA contributions, centers around whether withdrawals of any accumulated earnings will be taxed. This rule requires the account owners to wait at least five tax years from the time of their first contribution – whether it was made directly or via conversion – to withdraw earnings, provided they have reached age 59 ½. If you make subsequent contributions or open new Roth accounts, the clock does not restart.', 'For distributions of earnings to be qualified – that is, tax-free – you must satisfy the age requirement and this five-year rule. Exceptions to the age requirement exist for the death of the account owner, disabilities and first-time homebuyers. But even in the case of these exceptions, the five-year rule must be met or any earnings taken from the account will be taxable.', 'If you are at least 59 ½ years old but have not met the five-year rule requirement, then you will pay income taxes on any earnings that are withdrawn. Since contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, you can always withdraw the value of your contributions free of taxes and penalties, but any gains generated and distributed before the five-year period ends will be taxed. The distribution would also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are not 59 ½ years old. (Speak with a financial advisor if you need help navigating the five-year rule for your Roth IRA.)', 'The second five-year rule relates specifically to Roth conversions and whether an early withdrawal of converted principal will be taxed. In effect, the rule only applies if you take a distribution before you turn 59 ½.']\n"

That implies around a 10% decline from the benchmark index's current levels at around 5,222 on Monday.\", 'Inflation will likely remain stubbornly high, the strategists predicted, as the economy is coming out of what they described as a \"pseudo-recession\" that took place from early 2022 and lasted through the middle of 2023. That accounted for the bulk of the disinflation seen to date, and economic activity has since revved up.', '\"We have been wary of a broad S&P 500 correction in the middle quarters of 2024. While most strategists were expecting a recession last year or eagerly attempting to call the start of one in the next year, we have been of the view that the ~5 quarters 1Q22 to 2Q23 were a \\'pseudo-recession\\' and the Fed has already harvested all the normal post-recession disinflation we would expect,\" the firm wrote.', \"Inflation still remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew 3.5% year-per-year in March, the third straight month of hotter-than-expected inflation.\", 'Elevated prices could be attributed to a still-hot economy, which is stoking price growth, strategists said. Hiring activity, for instance, remains robust, which can stoke wage growth and therefore raise inflation.', '\"As a result, the sustained 2% Core PCE inflation the Feed seeks is a pipe dream. With rates normalized and the mid-2024 pop in Core PCE to just over 3% that our models indicate we expect Fed rate cuts to be pushed back further, causing a middle quarters correction for equities,\" strategists added.', \"Markets have already dialed back their outlook for Fed rate cuts this year, which drove a sell-of in stocks in April. Fed officials have said they're looking for more evidence that inflation is falling back to its 2% price target, and investors are now just expecting one or two rate cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool, compared to six at the start of 2024.\", \"Traders are waiting for April inflation data to roll out this week, but central bankers are largely expected to keep interest rates at their current levels. Markets have priced in a 96% chance rates will be kept level at the Fed's next policy meeting, and a 75% chance rates will stay the same all summer.\", 'Read the original article on Business Insider']\n"

      "['In the realm of retirement savings, only a select few in the United States achieve the milestone of a $5 million nest egg.', 'Data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, based on the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, reveals that a mere 0.1% of retirees manage to accumulate over $5 million in their retirement accounts, whereas only 3.2% amass over $1 million.', \"Don't Miss:\", '82% of Americans aren’t using this government secured 5% passive income stream, are you one of them?', 'Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.', 'A look at those with around $5 million in savings, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, shows that such retirees often did not anticipate reaching such financial heights. They were consistent in their savings efforts from early in their careers, yet their lifestyles remained modest. Many continue to work part-time, forego frequent new clothing purchases, and, while they do splurge on global travel, they share the same concerns about health and family as other older Americans.', \"Meanwhile, Northwestern Mutual’s research indicates that Americans believe they need around $1.46 million to retire comfortably. Yet, the median retirement savings account balance paints a grimmer picture, standing at only $87,000, according to the latest figures from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. Here’s how these figures breakdown by age group:\", '—Under 35: $18,880', '—35-44: $45,000', '—45-54: $115,000', '—55-64: $185,000', '—65-74: $200,000', '—75 or older: $130,000', 'While the average balance across all families is higher at $333,940, this number is skewed upward by the wealthiest households. Besides retirement accounts, many retirees also have substantial amounts held in regular savings, brokerage accounts, and investment properties.', 'The equity in a retiree’s home also significantly contributes to their financial security. In 2021, home equity accounted for a median of 45% of the total net worth of U.S. homeowners, indicating a significant portion of an average person’s wealth comes from their primary residence.', 'The picture of American retirees’ financial health is thus more nuanced than it appears. Financial planners advise considering all assets and net worth to fully assess retirement readiness, rather than focusing solely on retirement account balances.', 'Although a $5 million nest egg is rare, achieving a comfortable retirement is still within reach. By consulting with a financial advisor, you can develop a tailored plan to meet your retirement goals based on your financial situation and lifestyle aspirations. A financial advisor can provide valuable insights and strategies to help you maximize your savings and ensure financial security for your retirement years.']\n"
